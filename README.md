I found the data added to this dataset in a scientific article of a magazine "Radiation and risk". They published data collected and provided by the Byelorussian center of Medical Technologies.
The cases are divided into 2 groups: cases before the accident in years 1977 - 1985 and after the accident in the period from 1986 till 1994.
In the dataset, so that it is easier to operate, I used 2 dates instead: 1985 and 1986, referring to the 2 period 1977 - 1985 and 1986 till 1994 respectively.
The data was collected for the cities of Gomel, Mogilev and for the whole country of Belarus.
The cases are provided per 100.000 people.
